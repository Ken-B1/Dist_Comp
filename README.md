To run the code:
 - Load the p4food, p4food_war and statistics_ejb projects into netbeans
 - Clean and build p4food, and run it
 - Clean and build statistics_ejb and deploy it, in that order
	
- Add the reference database to netbeans by copying it to the correct directory
- Make sure that the persistence file references to the correct datasource.

- Copy all the images in the /Images folder to "${home_dir}/p4foodPictures/". This is the directory used by the program to store and retrieve images.
The project should now be runnable
