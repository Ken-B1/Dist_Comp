WebAPP:

To run the code:
 - Load the p4food, p4food_war and statistics_ejb projects into netbeans
 - Add the reference database to netbeans by copying it to the correct directory
 - Make sure that the persistence file references to the correct datasource.
 - Copy all the images in the /Images folder to "${home_dir}/p4foodPictures/". This is the directory used by the program to store and retrieve images. This is not mandatory, but to display the correct images it is.
