Functionalities currently implemented are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Registration:} A user can create an account. All the settings defined in the assignment are included.
\item \textbf{Login:} A user can use the account he created to log in. When a user logs in, a \textbf{session} will be created keeping the user logged in until he logs out or a timeout happens.
\item \textbf{Statistics:} When a user logs in, this gets saved into the database. On the statistics page a user can request the statistics about his login attempts.
\item \textbf{Settings:} A logged in user can access his settings and update them. (Currently all the settings except for the email)
\end{itemize}
