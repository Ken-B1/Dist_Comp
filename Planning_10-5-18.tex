\textbf{These are the planned features for 10/5/2018. Most of these should be done by then}

\section{Front-end}
\begin{itemize}
\item Move the big box on the frontpage with the follower/following count to the account page
\item Improve how the login and registration page look. Add a logout button
\item Add the facebook button in a nice location
\item Change the category selection page (The one you see when you log in for the first time) to allow more categories to be shown (When we have 50 categories, the current window will not look good)
\item Improve the way a board is displayed in the boards page. Add buttons to update/delete a board. A board has to be clickable to redirect the user to the pins page for that board (The functionality for this is backend stuff)
\item Add a way to change the settings of a board to private/public
\item Improve the way a pin is displayed (title \& image). Add buttons to update/delete a pin. A pin has to be clickable, which will redirect the user to a pin overview page with the entire recipe and extra details in it.
\item Make a page for an entire recipe (entire pin) as described in the previous item 
\item Create the popup thing for notifications, messages, and activities
\item Create a page to show search results (This is a simple page with the header and a collection of pins)
\item Create a User page where a user can see his boards/pins/followers/following (See pinterest for inspiration)
\item Create pages displaying followers and the people/boards you are following
\item Add a block button to each follower you have
\item Create a page for the explore feature. It should show the trending topics, rising topics and new topics
\item Make the administrator pages look better. These are the page to create new topics and the page to create a new administrator
\item Add a button to a user's profile page which allows an administrator to block this user. Also add a button to remove that user (Visibility of these buttons will be controlled by the backend so that only administrators can see the buttons)
\item Add nice visualisations for the administrator statistics 
\end{itemize}

\section{Back-end}
\begin{itemize}
\item Category selection when first loging in
\item Implement messages
\item Implement the search functionality for topics
\item Implement the explore feature (trending topics and rising topics?)
\item Add admin-specific statistics
\item Retrieve user-specific pins to be displayed on the front page
\item Image uploading for pins
\end{itemize}

\section{Partially done (Waiting for linking to front-end}
\begin{itemize}
\item Category selection when first loging in
\item CRUD boards and pins  (Things like privacy settings are not finished yet)
\item Implement notifications
\item Implement the search functionality for pins (topic search is front-end javascript selection because amount of topics is not that large so can be completely loaded to the frontend)
